# CrimeCast


## The features
To build a predictive model of crime rate based on various factors for a specific country using OECD data, I have gathered data on the following factors:

- Economic factors: Gross domestic product (GDP), inflation rate, unemployment rate, and poverty rate.

- Social factors: education level, healthcare access, income distribution, and demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity may be relevant to crime rates and should be taken into account.

- Environmental factors: air pollution, water quality, waste generation, and access to green spaces may have an impact on crime rates in certain areas and should be considered.

- Governance and institutional factors: government expenditure on law enforcement, judicial efficiency, corruption levels, and the quality of institutions.

- Technology factors: internet penetration, mobile phone usage, and broadband availability can also have an impact on crime rates.

# The data

## Economic factors
- GPD, CPI & inflation, Unemployment rate, Poverty

### Gross Domestic Product GPD

gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period of time, typically a year.

It is often used as an indicator of a country's economic health and is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders, including those produced by foreign-owned companies.

GDP can be expressed in nominal terms, which reflect current market prices, or in real terms, which adjust for inflation.

### CPI & inflation

#### Consumer Price Index (CPI)

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a fixed basket of goods and services. It is commonly used to track changes in the cost of living and is often used as a key indicator of inflation by policymakers and central banks.

#### Inflation

Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising over time. When inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than before. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including an increase in the supply of money, a decrease in the supply of goods and services, or an increase in demand for goods and services. Inflation can have significant economic effects, such as reducing the purchasing power of savings and leading to higher costs for businesses.

### Unemployment rate

The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is currently unemployed and actively seeking employment. It is often used as a key indicator of the health of the economy and the availability of jobs. The labor force is defined as all individuals who are of working age, not institutionalized, and either employed or actively seeking employment. The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total number of individuals in the labor force and multiplying by 100. A higher unemployment rate generally indicates that a larger proportion of the labor force is without work, while a lower unemployment rate suggests that there are more job opportunities available.

### Poverty rate

The poverty rate is the percentage of the population that falls below a certain income threshold, known as the poverty line. The poverty line is set at a level that is deemed to be the minimum income necessary to meet basic needs, such as food, shelter, and clothing. The poverty rate is often used as an indicator of the level of economic hardship in a population, and can be used to assess the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing poverty. The poverty rate is typically calculated by dividing the number of individuals whose income falls below the poverty line by the total population and multiplying by 100. A higher poverty rate indicates a greater number of individuals or families who are struggling to make ends meet, while a lower poverty rate suggests that more individuals have sufficient income to meet their basic needs.

## Social Factors

### Educational Level

Educational level refers to the highest level of education that an individual has completed, such as primary, secondary, or tertiary education. It is often used as an indicator of human capital, and can provide insights into a country's economic development, social mobility, and quality of life. Data on educational level can be used to track trends over time and make cross-country comparisons.

### Income Distribution

Income distribution refers to how income is divided among a population, including the share of income received by different groups and the degree of income inequality. It is often measured using indicators such as the Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). Understanding income distribution is important for assessing the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing poverty and promoting social mobility, as well as for understanding the potential impact of economic changes on different groups within a society.

### Demographics

#### Child poverty

Child poverty refers to the situation where children experience a lack of resources and opportunities compared to their peers, resulting in deprivation and exclusion from a decent standard of living. It is measured using various indicators, such as household income, material deprivation, and social exclusion.

#### Family size and coverage

Family size and coverage refer to the number of children in a family and the availability and adequacy of services and benefits that support families in raising children. This includes policies related to parental leave, child care services, child allowances, and tax credits for families.

#### Intimate partner violence

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pattern of behavior in which one partner uses physical, sexual, or psychological violence to control and dominate the other partner in an intimate relationship. It can have serious health and social consequences, including physical injury, emotional trauma, and social isolation.

#### Living conditions of children

Living conditions of children refer to the quality of the physical and social environments in which children grow up. This includes access to adequate housing, safe and clean water and sanitation, health care, education, and social services. Poor living conditions can have negative effects on children's health, well-being, and development.

## Deep data
The dataset is huge, and is only meant for worst-case scenarious where particular data is missing, but would be a neccesity to our models. As such, the data is not meant to be used, but is there as a worst case scenario.
